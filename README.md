# <Sky Stability Checker>

## Module Six Challenge

The goal of this challenge was to create a simple weather app that pulls API data from the OpenWeatherMapAPI. The app diplays current weather data for a searched city, as well as a five day forecast for the selected city. Full criteria were as follows:

- GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
- WHEN I search for a city
- THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
- WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
- THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the the wind speed
- WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
- THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
- WHEN I click on a city in the search history
- THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
